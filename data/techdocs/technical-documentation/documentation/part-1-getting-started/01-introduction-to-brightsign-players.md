## Operating System

BrightSign OS (BOS) is a customized Linux distribution built on the Yocto and OpenEmbedded projects. The architecture reflects a minimal-footprint philosophy: rather than starting with a full Linux distribution and removing components, BOS was constructed from a clean slate with only essential functionality.

**Current Versions:**
- **BOS 9.x**: Current release with Chromium 87 (9.0.x) or 120 (9.1.x), Node.js 14.17.6 or 18.18.2
- **BOS 8.x**: Stable release with Chromium 69-87, Node.js 10.15.3-14.17.6
- Series 5 players support Chromium 110/120 upgrades for latest web standards

**Architecture Components:**
- Read-only root filesystem stored in flash memory
- Chromium rendering engine for HTML/JavaScript (version varies by OS)
- Custom audio/video processing pipeline with hardware acceleration
- Hardware abstraction layer for media decode and GPU operations
- dm-verity secure boot with signed firmware validation

**Design Philosophy:**
BOS is not a general-purpose operating system. It provides specialized capabilities for digital signage rather than attempting to function as a traditional Linux PC. This focused design enables:
- Deterministic boot times (typically under 15 seconds)
- Minimal attack surface with signed firmware and secure boot
- Optimized resource utilization for media playback
- Atomic over-the-air updates with rollback capability

## Development Environment Setup

BrightSign development requires both hardware and software components.

**Required Hardware:**
- BrightSign player with power supply
- MicroSD card (Class 10 or UHS-I recommended) or USB storage
- Development computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Display with HDMI input
- HDMI cable
- Network connection (Ethernet recommended for development)
- Optional: USB-to-serial adapter for console access

**Development Tools:**

**Diagnostic Web Server (DWS)**
Built-in web interface accessible at `http://<player-ip>` providing:
- Player settings configuration
- System diagnostic information and logs
- File management and upload
- Screenshot capture and performance metrics
- REST API for programmatic access

Available in both Local DWS (LDWS, on-network) and Remote DWS (RDWS, via BSN.cloud) variants.

> **Note:** As of recent firmware updates, the DWS is **disabled by default** due to EU Radio Equipment Directive (RED) compliance requirements. You must explicitly enable it by running a short BrightScript on the player:
> ```brightscript
> reg = CreateObject("roRegistrySection", "networking")
> reg.Write("dwse", "yes")
> reg.Flush()
> CreateObject("roNetworkConfiguration", 0).SetupDWS({port:"80", open:"none"})
> ```
> This enables the DWS on port 80 with authentication required. Detailed setup instructions are covered in later chapters.

**Node.js Environment**
Players ship with two Node.js instances:
- Embedded in Chromium (for HTML widget JavaScript)
- Standalone (for Node.js applications)

| OS Version | Node.js Version |
|------------|-----------------|
| BOS 9.1.x | 18.18.2 |
| BOS 8.5.x - 9.0.x | 14.17.6 |
| BOS 8.1.x - 8.3.x | 10.15.3 |

**Local DWS Command-Line Interface (requires Local DWS to be enabled)**
The `@brightsign/bsc` CLI tool communicates with the Local DWS REST APIs:
```bash
npm install -g @brightsign/bsc
```
Provides file operations, registry management, screenshots, power control, and system diagnostics from your development machine.

**Remote DWS Command-Line Interface (requires use of BSN.cloud)**

The [gopurple SDK](https://github.com/BrightDevelopers/gopurple) includes 34 ready-to-use command-line tools for remote device management via the Remote Diagnostic Web Server (rDWS) API. These tools enable you to manage players from anywhere through BSN.cloud.

Key capabilities include:
- Device information and health monitoring (`rdws-info`, `rdws-health`, `rdws-diagnostics`)
- Remote reboot and reprovisioning (`rdws-reboot`, `rdws-reprovision`)
- File operations on player storage (`rdws-files-list`, `rdws-files-upload`, `rdws-files-delete`)
- Network troubleshooting (`rdws-ping`, `rdws-dns-lookup`, `rdws-traceroute`, `rdws-packet-capture`)
- Log and crash dump retrieval (`rdws-logs-get`, `rdws-crashdump-get`)
- Registry management (`rdws-registry-get`, `rdws-registry-set`)
- Remote access configuration (`rdws-ssh`, `rdws-telnet`, `rdws-dws-password`)
- Screenshot capture (`rdws-snapshot`)

See the complete list with usage examples in the [gopurple examples documentation](https://github.com/BrightDevelopers/gopurple/blob/main/examples/README.md#remote-dws-operations-34).

**BrightSign Shell & BrightScript Debugger**
Command-line interface for BrightSign OS interaction via serial cable (115200 baud, 8N1) or telnet/SSH. The BrightScript debugger provides breakpoints, variable inspection, and step-through debugging.

## Getting Started

BrightSign supports two primary development approaches:
- **BrightScript**: Proprietary scripting language with direct hardware access
- **JavaScript/HTML5**: Web-based development using the Chromium engine

### First Project: BrightScript Video Player

1. **Prepare SD Card:**
   Format as FAT32 (for cards ≤32GB) or exFAT (for larger cards).

2. **Create autorun.brs:**
   ```brightscript
   ' Simple looping video example
   videoPlayer = CreateObject("roVideoPlayer")
   videoPlayer.SetLoopMode(true)
   videoPlayer.PlayFile("video.mp4")

   ' Event loop (required to keep script running)
   msgPort = CreateObject("roMessagePort")
   videoPlayer.SetPort(msgPort)

   while true
       msg = wait(0, msgPort)
       if type(msg) = "roVideoEvent" then
           print "Video event: "; msg.GetInt()
       end if
   end while
   ```

3. **Deploy:** Copy `autorun.brs` and `video.mp4` to SD card root, insert into player, and power on.

### First Project: HTML5 Application

1. **Create autorun.brs** to launch an HTML widget:
   ```brightscript
   ' Launch HTML5 application
   rect = CreateObject("roRectangle", 0, 0, 1920, 1080)
   config = { url: "file:///sd:/index.html" }
   htmlWidget = CreateObject("roHtmlWidget", rect, config)

   msgPort = CreateObject("roMessagePort")
   htmlWidget.SetPort(msgPort)

   while true
       msg = wait(0, msgPort)
   end while
   ```

2. **Create index.html** with your web application.

3. **Deploy:** Copy all files to SD card and boot player.

### Development Workflow

1. **Write code** on development machine (BrightScript or HTML/JS)
2. **Deploy** via SD card, USB, or network (using `bsc` CLI or DWS)
3. **Test** on player, checking serial console or DWS logs for errors
4. **Iterate** using the DWS file upload for rapid testing
5. **Deploy to production** via BSN.cloud or CMS

### Deployment Strategies

| Strategy | Best For | Method |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Local | 1-10 players, demos | Manual SD card updates |
| Network | 10+ players, enterprise | BSN.cloud or third-party CMS |
| Hybrid | Initial setup + updates | SD card provisioning, network updates |
